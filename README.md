## STEPS TO BE FOLLOW BEFORE FLASHING A CUSTOM ROM

### SO HERE I CHOOSE RUI2 BASED INDEPTH APK TO UNLOCK BOOTLOADER SO I CAN FLASH CUSTOM ROM BASED ON RUI2  MANY CUSTOM ROMS ARE AVAILABLE FOR RUI1 AND RUI3 I EARLY MENTION I WAS GOING TO USE RUI2 BASED CROM SO I GONNA UNLOCK BOOTLOADER ON RUI2 BEFORE THAT ENABLE USB DEBUGGING AND OEM UNLOCKING IN DEVELOPER OPTIONS

### ENTER THE APP KNOWN AS INDEPTH APK AND START APPLYING APPLICATION AFTER APPLYING APPLICATION START DEEPTESTING AND THE PHONE WILL BOOT INTO FASTBOOT MODE THATS THE PLACE WERE WE CAN USE COMMAND TO UNLOCK THE BOOTLOADER
